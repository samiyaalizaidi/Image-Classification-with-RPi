# CPE 4903: Neural Networks and Machine Learning 
The purpose of this project is to train two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): 'Hand Digit Recognition' and 'Cats and Dogs Classification.' The models will then be deployed on a Raspberry Pi to perform inference through PiCamera. 

The Hand Digit Classifier was required to have an accuracy of $`\geq 99\%`$ whereas the Cats and Dogs Classification model must have an accuracy of $`\geq 85\%`$.
